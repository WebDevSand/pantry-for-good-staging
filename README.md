This repository is for the Pantry-for-Good application designed by Open Source for Good Contributors at [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). For deployment instructions see the [deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).

If you'd like to contribute, the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the git workflow and the [developers guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/pantry-for-good/wiki/developer's-guide) gives an overview of how the app works. The [open issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/pantry-for-good/issues) are a good place to start, or you can try the app and add your own issues. If you get stuck or need help with something, feel free to leave a comment.

Some issues are quite large, don't feel like you have to finish them, it's ok. Little bits help too! Start slow! 

There's a demo app hosted at https://pantry-for-good.herokuapp.com, though it might be a bit behind the current version.
